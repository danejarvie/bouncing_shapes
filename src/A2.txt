How much time did the assignment take overall?
The base part of the assignment probably took about 5 hours.  I probably spent another 5-8hrs on the extra
features I added such as the background image and sound clips.

What areas did I find easy?
Parts 2, 3a, and 4 I found to be relatively easy.  They required adding similar functionality to what was
already present in the template.

What areas did I find difficult?
Parts 3b, and 3c (and Part 1 to a certain extent) were trickier as they required research into classes outside
the scope of our lecture content.  Part 3c was the most difficult.  The technique I used was to use an
AffineTransform to rotate the square shapes.  It took a while to get my head around what an AffineTransform is
and how it should be used.

Which topics of the course did the assignment most help you understand?
Definitely the concepts of Inheritance and Variable Scope.  The usage of superclasses and subclasses with
protected instance variables was really instructive.

Any other comments you would like to make.
This was a good assignment and I feel practised for having done it.  What it could have included more detail
around was anonymous classes and the use of EventListeners.  It would have been good to have had a question
that required us to create a widget that did not already have precedence in the template and to add an
appropriate Listener to it.  That would have required us to write some Listener code from scratch.
